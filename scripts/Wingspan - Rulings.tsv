20210199b		Superb Lyrebird	When this bird copies another bird's power, it retains any effects specified in the copied bird's power text as long as those effects may occur but not beyond the end of the turn. (So, e.g., if it copies the \textbf{Coal Tit}'s power, it retains the ability to spend [seed] cached on this bird until the end of the turn but no longer, and if copies the \textbf{Wood Duck}'s power, the copied power still obligates you to discard a card at the end of your turn.)	https://www.facebook.com/groups/wingspanboardgame/permalink/714240602612878/?comment_id=714367625933509

(So, e.g., if the \textbf{Superb Lyrebird} copies the \textbf{Coal Tit}'s power, the former bird retains the ability to spend [seed] cached on it until the end of the turn but no longer, and if it instead copies the \textbf{Wood Duck}'s power, the copied power still obligates you to discard a card at the end of your turn.)	https://www.facebook.com/groups/wingspanboardgame/permalink/714240602612878/?comment_id=714367625933509
